# **Levenshtein Distance Implementation**
This repository contains an implementation of the **Levenshtein Distance** algorithm, also known as **edit distance**. This technique is widely used in various fields, such as:

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Comparing strings for tasks like word similarity detection and text analysis.
- **Search Systems**: Correcting typos and providing search suggestions.
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifying similar patterns in strings.
- **Bioinformatics**: Analyzing DNA, RNA, or protein sequences.


#### **Objectives**
- Provide a solid foundation for understanding how the algorithm works.
- Demonstrate practical applications of Levenshtein Distance in different scenarios.
- Enable extensions and customizations for specific use cases.
